# Requirements Traceability & Gate Decision - Validation Checklist

**Workflow:** `testarch-trace`
**Purpose:** Ensure complete traceability matrix with actionable gap analysis AND make deployment readiness decision (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED)

This checklist covers **two sequential phases**:

- **PHASE 1**: Requirements Traceability (always executed)
- **PHASE 2**: Quality Gate Decision (executed if `enable_gate_decision: true`)

---

# PHASE 1: REQUIREMENTS TRACEABILITY

## Prerequisites Validation

- [ ] Acceptance criteria are available (from story file OR inline)
- [ ] Test suite exists (or gaps are acknowledged and documented)
- [ ] If tests are missing, recommend `*atdd` (trace does not run it automatically)
- [ ] Test directory path is correct (`test_dir` variable)
- [ ] Story file is accessible (if using BMad mode)
- [ ] Knowledge base is loaded (test-priorities, traceability, risk-governance)

---

## Context Loading

- [ ] Story file read successfully (if applicable)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria extracted correctly
- [ ] Story ID identified (e.g., 1.3)
- [ ] `test-design.md` loaded (if available)
- [ ] `tech-spec.md` loaded (if available)
- [ ] `PRD.md` loaded (if available)
- [ ] Relevant knowledge fragments loaded from `tea-index.csv`

---

## Test Discovery and Cataloging

- [ ] Tests auto-discovered using multiple strategies (test IDs, describe blocks, file paths)
- [ ] Tests categorized by level (E2E, API, Component, Unit)
- [ ] Test metadata extracted:
  - [ ] Test IDs (e.g., 1.3-E2E-001)
  - [ ] Describe/context blocks
  - [ ] It blocks (individual test cases)
  - [ ] Given-When-Then structure (if BDD)
  - [ ] Priority markers (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- [ ] All relevant test files found (no tests missed due to naming conventions)

---

## Criteria-to-Test Mapping

- [ ] Each acceptance criterion mapped to tests (or marked as NONE)
- [ ] Explicit references found (test IDs, describe blocks mentioning criterion)
- [ ] Test level documented (E2E, API, Component, Unit)
- [ ] Given-When-Then narrative verified for alignment
- [ ] Traceability matrix table generated:
  - [ ] Criterion ID
  - [ ] Description
  - [ ] Test ID
  - [ ] Test File
  - [ ] Test Level
  - [ ] Coverage Status

---

## Coverage Classification

- [ ] Coverage status classified for each criterion:
  - [ ] **FULL** - All scenarios validated at appropriate level(s)
  - [ ] **PARTIAL** - Some coverage but missing edge cases or levels
  - [ ] **NONE** - No test coverage at any level
  - [ ] **UNIT-ONLY** - Only unit tests (missing integration/E2E validation)
  - [ ] **INTEGRATION-ONLY** - Only API/Component tests (missing unit confidence)
- [ ] Classification justifications provided
- [ ] Edge cases considered in FULL vs PARTIAL determination

---

## Duplicate Coverage Detection

- [ ] Duplicate coverage checked across test levels
- [ ] Acceptable overlap identified (defense in depth for critical paths)
- [ ] Unacceptable duplication flagged (same validation at multiple levels)
- [ ] Recommendations provided for consolidation
- [ ] Selective testing principles applied

---

## Gap Analysis

- [ ] Coverage gaps identified:
  - [ ] Criteria with NONE status
  - [ ] Criteria with PARTIAL status
  - [ ] Criteria with UNIT-ONLY status
  - [ ] Criteria with INTEGRATION-ONLY status
- [ ] Gaps prioritized by risk level using test-priorities framework:
  - [ ] **CRITICAL** - P0 criteria without FULL coverage (BLOCKER)
  - [ ] **HIGH** - P1 criteria without FULL coverage (PR blocker)
  - [ ] **MEDIUM** - P2 criteria without FULL coverage (nightly gap)
  - [ ] **LOW** - P3 criteria without FULL coverage (acceptable)
- [ ] Specific test recommendations provided for each gap:
  - [ ] Suggested test level (E2E, API, Component, Unit)
  - [ ] Test description (Given-When-Then)
  - [ ] Recommended test ID (e.g., 1.3-E2E-004)
  - [ ] Explanation of why test is needed

---

## Coverage Metrics

- [ ] Overall coverage percentage calculated (FULL coverage / total criteria)
- [ ] P0 coverage percentage calculated
- [ ] P1 coverage percentage calculated
- [ ] P2 coverage percentage calculated (if applicable)
- [ ] Coverage by level calculated:
  - [ ] E2E coverage %
  - [ ] API coverage %
  - [ ] Component coverage %
  - [ ] Unit coverage %

---

## Test Quality Verification

For each mapped test, verify:

- [ ] Explicit assertions are present (not hidden in helpers)
- [ ] Test follows Given-When-Then structure
- [ ] No hard waits or sleeps (deterministic waiting only)
- [ ] Self-cleaning (test cleans up its data)
- [ ] File size < 300 lines
- [ ] Test duration < 90 seconds

Quality issues flagged:

- [ ] **BLOCKER** issues identified (missing assertions, hard waits, flaky patterns)
- [ ] **WARNING** issues identified (large files, slow tests, unclear structure)
- [ ] **INFO** issues identified (style inconsistencies, missing documentation)

Knowledge fragments referenced:

- [ ] `test-quality.md` for Definition of Done
- [ ] `fixture-architecture.md` for self-cleaning patterns
- [ ] `network-first.md` for Playwright best practices
- [ ] `data-factories.md` for test data patterns

- [ ] Regulatory requirements addressed (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation sufficient for external audit

---

## Phase 2 Edge Cases and Exceptions

### Missing Evidence

- [ ] If test-design.md missing, decision still possible with test results + trace
- [ ] If traceability-matrix.md missing, decision still possible with test results (but Phase 1 should provide it)
- [ ] If nfr-assessment.md missing, NFR validation marked as NOT ASSESSED
- [ ] If code coverage missing, coverage criterion marked as NOT ASSESSED
- [ ] User acknowledged gaps in evidence or provided alternative proof

### Stale Evidence

- [ ] Evidence freshness checked (if validate_evidence_freshness: true)
- [ ] Warnings issued for assessments >7 days old
- [ ] User acknowledged stale evidence or re-ran workflows
- [ ] Decision document notes any stale evidence used

### Conflicting Evidence

- [ ] Conflicts between test results and assessments resolved
- [ ] Most recent/authoritative source identified
- [ ] Conflict resolution documented in decision rationale
- [ ] User consulted if conflict cannot be resolved

### Waiver Scenarios

- [ ] Waiver only used for FAIL decision (not PASS or CONCERNS)
- [ ] Waiver has business justification (not technical convenience)
- [ ] Waiver has named approver with authority (VP/CTO/PO)
- [ ] Waiver has expiry date (does NOT apply to future releases)
- [ ] Waiver has remediation plan with concrete due date
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities are NOT waived (enforced)
