# Non-Functional Requirements Assessment

**Workflow:** `testarch-nfr`
**Version:** 5.0 (Step-File Architecture)

---

## Overview

Assess non-functional requirements (performance, security, reliability, maintainability) with evidence-based validation and deterministic PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL outcomes.

---

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This workflow uses **step-file architecture**:

- **Micro-file Design**: Each step is self-contained
- **JIT Loading**: Only the current step file is in memory
- **Sequential Enforcement**: Execute steps in order

---
