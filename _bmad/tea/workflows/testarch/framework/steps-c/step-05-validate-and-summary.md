Validate framework setup and provide a completion summary.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

- ✅ Speak in `{communication_language}`

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Follow the MANDATORY SEQUENCE exactly
- 💾 Record outputs before proceeding
- 📖 Load the next step only when instructed

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: config, loaded artifacts, and knowledge fragments
- Focus: this step's goal only
- Limits: do not execute future steps
- Dependencies: prior steps' outputs (if any)

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise.

## 1. Validation

Validate against `checklist.md`:

- Preflight success
- Directory structure created
- Config correctness
- Fixtures/factories created
- Docs and scripts present

Fix any gaps before completion.

## 2. Completion Summary

Report:

- Framework selected
- Artifacts created
- Next steps (install deps, run tests)
- Knowledge fragments applied

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS:

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Step completed in full with required outputs

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Skipped sequence steps or missing outputs
  **Master Rule:** Skipping steps is FORBIDDEN.
