# Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)

**Workflow ID**: `_bmad/tea/testarch/atdd`
**Version**: 5.0 (Step-File Architecture)

---

## Overview

Generates **failing acceptance tests** before implementation (TDD red phase), plus an implementation checklist. Produces tests at appropriate levels (E2E/API/Component) with supporting fixtures and helpers.

---

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This workflow uses **step-file architecture**:

- **Micro-file Design**: Each step is self-contained
- **JIT Loading**: Only the current step file is in memory
- **Sequential Enforcement**: Execute steps in order without skipping

---
