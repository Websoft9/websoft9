# CI/CD Pipeline Setup

**Workflow ID**: `_bmad/tea/testarch/ci`
**Version**: 5.0 (Step-File Architecture)

---

## Overview

Scaffold a production-ready CI/CD quality pipeline with test execution, burn-in loops for flaky detection, parallel sharding, artifact collection, and notifications.

---

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This workflow uses **step-file architecture**:

- **Micro-file Design**: Each step is self-contained
- **JIT Loading**: Only the current step file is in memory
- **Sequential Enforcement**: Execute steps in order
