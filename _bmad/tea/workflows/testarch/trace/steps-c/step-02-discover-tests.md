# Step 2: Discover & Catalog Tests

## STEP GOAL

Identify tests relevant to the requirements and classify by test level.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

- 📖 Read the entire step file before acting
- ✅ Speak in `{communication_language}`

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Follow the MANDATORY SEQUENCE exactly
- 💾 Record outputs before proceeding
- 📖 Load the next step only when instructed

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: config, loaded artifacts, and knowledge fragments
- Focus: this step's goal only
- Limits: do not execute future steps
- Dependencies: prior steps' outputs (if any)

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise.

## 1. Discover Tests

Search `{test_dir}` for:

- Test IDs (e.g., `1.3-E2E-001`)
- Feature name matches
- Spec patterns (`*.spec.*`, `*.test.*`)

---

## 2. Categorize by Level

Classify as:

- E2E
- API
- Component
- Unit

Record test IDs, describe blocks, and priority markers if present.

Load next step: `{nextStepFile}`

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS:

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Step completed in full with required outputs

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Skipped sequence steps or missing outputs
  **Master Rule:** Skipping steps is FORBIDDEN.
