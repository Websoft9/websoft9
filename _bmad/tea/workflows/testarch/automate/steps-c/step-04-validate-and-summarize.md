# Step 4: Validate & Summarize

## STEP GOAL

Validate generated outputs and produce a concise automation summary.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

- 📖 Read the entire step file before acting
- ✅ Speak in `{communication_language}`
- ✅ Validate against the checklist before completion

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Follow the MANDATORY SEQUENCE exactly
- 💾 Record outputs before proceeding
- 📖 Load the next step only when instructed

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: config, loaded artifacts, and knowledge fragments
- Focus: this step's goal only
- Limits: do not execute future steps
- Dependencies: prior steps' outputs (if any)

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise.

## 1. Validate

Use `checklist.md` to validate:

- Framework readiness
- Coverage mapping
- Test quality and structure
- Fixtures, factories, helpers

Fix gaps before proceeding.

## 2. Summary Output

Write `{outputFile}` including:

- Coverage plan by test level and priority
- Files created/updated
- Key assumptions and risks
- Next recommended workflow (e.g., `test-review` or `trace`)

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS:

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Step completed in full with required outputs

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Skipped sequence steps or missing outputs
  **Master Rule:** Skipping steps is FORBIDDEN.
