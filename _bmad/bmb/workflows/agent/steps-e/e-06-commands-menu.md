# Edit Step 6: Commands Menu

## STEP GOAL:

Review the agent's command menu and plan any additions, modifications, or removals.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: Load agentMenuPatterns first
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Load agentMenuPatterns before discussing menu edits
- 📊 Follow A/P/C convention for menu structure
- 💬 Focus on commands that user wants to add/modify/remove

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Load agentMenuPatterns.md
- 📊 Review current commands from editPlan
- 💾 Document planned command changes
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to proceed without documenting changes

## Sequence of Instructions:

### 1. Load Reference Documents

Read `{agentMenuPatterns}` to understand menu structure requirements.

### 2. Review Current Commands

From `{editPlan}`, display current commands with:
- trigger
- description
- handler/action

### 3. Discuss Command Edits

**For additions:**
- Define trigger (clear, intuitive, following conventions)
- Define description (concise, one line)
- Define handler/action (references capability)

**For modifications:**
- Update trigger, description, or handler
- Ensure still follows menu patterns

**For removals:**
- Identify commands to remove
- Confirm impact on agent functionality

### 4. Document to Edit Plan

Append to `{editPlan}`:

```yaml
commandEdits:
  additions:
    - trigger: {trigger}
      description: {description}
      handler: {handler}
  modifications:
    - command: {existing-command}
      changes: {what-to-change}
  removals:
    - command: {command-to-remove}
```

### 5. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Activation"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask}, and when finished redisplay the menu
- IF P: Execute {partyModeWorkflow}, and when finished redisplay the menu
- IF C: Save to {editPlan}, then only then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#5-present-menu-options)

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- After other menu items execution, return to this menu

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN [C continue option] is selected and [command changes documented], will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin activation planning.
