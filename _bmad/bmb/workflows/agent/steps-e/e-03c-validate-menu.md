# Edit Step 3c: Validate Menu (Before Edit)

## STEP GOAL:

Validate the agent's command menu structure against BMAD standards. Record findings to editPlan and auto-advance.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- 🔄 CRITICAL: Read editPlan and agentMenuPatterns first
- 🚫 NO MENU in this step - record findings and auto-advance
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Validate command/menu structure

- **Command descriptions**: specific, actionable
- **Menu handling logic**: properly specified

### 3. Record Findings

Append to editPlan frontmatter:

```yaml
  menu:
    status: [pass|fail|warning]
    findings:
      - {check}: [pass|fail]
      - {check}: [pass|fail]
```

### 4. Auto-Advance

When validation complete, load and execute `{nextStepFile}` immediately.
