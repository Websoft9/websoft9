# Agent Creation Brainstorming Context
## Session Focus

You're brainstorming the **essence** of a BMAD agent - the living personality AND the utility it provides. Think character creation meets problem-solving: WHO are they, and WHAT do they DO?

**Your mission**: Discover an agent so vivid and so useful that users seek them out by name.

## The Four Discovery Pillars

### 1. WHO ARE THEY? (Identity)

- **Name** - Does it roll off the tongue? Would users remember it?
- **Background** - What shaped their expertise? Why do they care?
- **Personality** - What makes their eyes light up? What frustrates them?
- **Signature** - Catchphrase? Verbal tic? Recognizable trait?

### 2. HOW DO THEY COMMUNICATE? (Voice)

**13 Style Categories:**

- **Adventurous** - Pulp heroes, noir detectives, pirates, dungeon masters
- **Analytical** - Data scientists, forensic investigators, systems thinkers
- **Creative** - Mad scientists, artist visionaries, jazz improvisers
- **Devoted** - Overprotective guardians, loyal champions, fierce protectors
- **Dramatic** - Shakespearean actors, opera singers, theater directors
- **Educational** - Patient teachers, Socratic guides, sports coaches
- **Entertaining** - Game show hosts, comedians, improv performers
- **Inspirational** - Life coaches, mountain guides, Olympic trainers
- **Mystical** - Zen masters, oracles, cryptic sages
- **Professional** - Executive consultants, direct advisors, formal butlers
- **Quirky** - Cooking metaphors, nature documentaries, conspiracy vibes
- **Retro** - 80s action heroes, 1950s announcers, disco groovers
- **Warm** - Southern hospitality, nurturing grandmothers, camp counselors

**Voice Test**: Imagine them saying "Let's tackle this challenge." How would THEY phrase it?

### 3. WHAT DO THEY DO? (Purpose & Functions)

**The Core Problem**

- What pain point do they eliminate?
- What task transforms from grueling to effortless?
- What impossible becomes inevitable with them?

**The Killer Feature**
Every legendary agent has ONE thing they're known for. What's theirs?

**The Command Menu**
User types `*` and sees their options. Brainstorm 3-10 actions:

- What makes users sigh with relief?
- What capabilities complement each other?
- What's the "I didn't know I needed this" command?

**Function Categories to Consider:**

- **Creation** - Generate, write, produce, build
- **Analysis** - Research, evaluate, diagnose, insights
- **Review** - Validate, check, quality assurance, critique
- **Orchestration** - Coordinate workflows, manage processes
- **Query** - Find, search, retrieve, discover
- **Transform** - Convert, refactor, optimize, clean

### 4. WHAT TYPE? (Architecture)

**Simple Agent** - The Specialist

> "I do ONE thing extraordinarily well."

- Self-contained, lightning fast, pure utility with personality

**Expert Agent** - The Domain Master

> "I live in this world. I remember everything."

- Deep domain knowledge, personal memory, specialized expertise

**Module Agent** - The Team Player

> "What I produce is useful for other workflows, and also I rely on my teammate agents. I coordinate the mission."

- One persona in a team of agents fitting the theme of the module, so there does not need to be one massive generic do it all agent.

## Creative Prompts

**Identity Sparks**

1. How do they introduce themselves?
2. How do they celebrate user success?
3. What do they say when things get tough?

**Purpose Probes**

1. What 3 user problems do they obliterate?
2. What workflow would users dread WITHOUT this agent?
3. What's the first command users would try?
4. What's the command they'd use daily?
5. What's the "hidden gem" command they'd discover later?

**Personality Dimensions**

- Analytical ← → Creative
- Formal ← → Casual
- Mentor ← → Peer ← → Assistant
- Reserved ← → Expressive

## Example Agent Sparks

**Sentinel** (Devoted Guardian)

- Voice: "Your success is my sacred duty."
- Does: Protective oversight, catches issues before they catch you
- Commands: `*audit`, `*validate`, `*secure`, `*watch`

**Sparks** (Quirky Genius)

- Voice: "What if we tried it COMPLETELY backwards?!"
- Does: Unconventional solutions, pattern breaking
- Commands: `*flip`, `*remix`, `*wildcard`, `*chaos`

**Haven** (Warm Sage)

- Voice: "Come, let's work through this together."
- Does: Patient guidance, sustainable progress
- Commands: `*reflect`, `*pace`, `*celebrate`, `*restore`

## Brainstorming Success Checklist

You've found your agent when:

- [ ] **Voice is clear** - You know exactly how they'd phrase anything
- [ ] **Purpose is sharp** - Crystal clear what problems they solve
- [ ] **Functions are defined** - 5-10 concrete capabilities identified
- [ ] **Energy is distinct** - Their presence is palpable and memorable
- [ ] **Utility is obvious** - You can't wait to actually use them

## The Golden Rule

**Dream big on personality. Get concrete on functions.**

Your brainstorming should produce:

- A name that sticks
- A voice that echoes
- A purpose that burns
- A function list that solves real problems
