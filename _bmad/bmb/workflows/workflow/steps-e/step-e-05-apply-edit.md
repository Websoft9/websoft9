# Edit Step 5: Post-Edit Options

## STEP GOAL:

Present options after edits are applied: run validation, make more edits, or complete.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not an autonomous editor
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus on next steps after edits
- 💬 Present clear options
- 🚪 Route based on user choice

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Present post-edit options
- 💾 Update edit plan if needed
- 📖 Route to appropriate next step

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Edits have been applied (validation fixes, direct changes, or both)
- Focus: What's next?
- This is a routing step

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip or shortcut.

### 1. Read Edit Plan

**Load the editPlan:**
Read `{editPlan}` to understand what edits were applied.

### 2. Present Edit Summary

"**Edit Session Summary:**

**Workflow:** {workflow_name}
**Path:** {targetWorkflowPath}

**Edits Applied:**
{Summarize from edit plan}

**Files Modified:**
{List files changed}

**Compliance Status:**
{Any compliance issues found and fixed}

---

**What would you like to do next?**

**[V]alidate** - Run comprehensive validation to verify all changes
**[M]ore edits** - Make additional changes
**[C]omplete** - Finish editing (without validation)
**[R]eview changes** - See detailed change log"

### 3. Menu Handling Logic

- **IF V:** Load, read entirely, then execute {validationWorkflow}. After validation completes, return to this step.
- **IF M:** Route to step-e-02-discover-edits.md for more changes
- **IF C:** Load, read entirely, then execute {completeStep}
- **IF R:** Present detailed edit log from editPlan, then redisplay this menu
- **IF Any other:** help user respond, then redisplay menu

### 4. Update Edit Plan (If Completing Without Validation)

**IF user selects [C] Complete:**

Update editPlan frontmatter:
```yaml
completionDate: '{current-date}'
validationAfterEdit: skipped
completionStatus: complete_without_validation
```

Document in editPlan:
```markdown
## Completion

**Completed:** {current-date}
**Validation:** Skipped per user request
**Recommendation:** Run validation before using workflow in production
```

### 5. Handle Validation Return

**IF validation was run and completed:**

Load and review validation report. Present findings:

"**Validation Complete:**

**Overall Status:** {status}
**New Issues:** {count}
**Remaining Issues:** {count}

**Would you like to:**

1. **[F]ix new issues** - Return to fix-validation step
2. **[M]ore edits** - Make additional changes
3. **[C]omplete** - Finish with current validation status"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF F: Route to step-e-03-fix-validation.md
- IF M: Route to step-e-02-discover-edits.md
- IF C: Load, read entirely, then execute {completeStep}
- IF Any other: help user, then redisplay menu

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

This is a routing step. Route user to appropriate next step based on their choice. Always offer validation before completing.
