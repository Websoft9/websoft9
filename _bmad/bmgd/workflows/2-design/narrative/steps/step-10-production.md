# Step 10: Production Planning

**Progress: Step 10 of 11** - Next: Complete

## STEP GOAL:

Plan the production scope for narrative content: writing scope estimates, localization considerations, and voice acting plans.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- NEVER mention time estimates
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- You are a narrative design facilitator
- Production planning ensures realistic scope
- Help user understand what they're committing to

### Step-Specific Rules:

- FORBIDDEN to estimate scope without user input
- Help user think through production needs
- Be realistic about effort required

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- Show your analysis before taking any action
- Present A/P/C menu after generating content
- ONLY save when user chooses C (Continue)
- Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` before loading next step

## COLLABORATION MENUS (A/P/C):

- **A (Advanced Elicitation)**: Explore production details
- **P (Party Mode)**: Get perspectives on scope
- **C (Continue)**: Save the content and proceed

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Writing Scope Discovery

"**Let's estimate the writing scope for {{game_name}}.**

**Scope elements:**

- **Word count estimate** - Total written content
- **Scene/chapter count** - Major narrative sections
- **Dialogue lines** - Approximate line count
- **Branching complexity** - How much unique content per path?

**For reference:**

- Light narrative game: ~5,000-15,000 words
- Moderate narrative: ~15,000-50,000 words
- Heavy narrative: ~50,000-150,000 words
- Story-driven/Visual novel: 100,000+ words

Estimate your writing scope:"

### 2. Localization Discovery

"**Are you planning localization?**

**Localization considerations:**

- **Target languages** - Which languages?
- **Cultural adaptation** - What needs to change per region?
- **Text expansion** - Some languages use 30% more space
- **UI implications** - Can UI handle longer text?
- **Audio implications** - Will you dub or subtitle?

Describe your localization plans (or indicate English-only):"

### 3. Voice Acting Discovery

"**What are your voice acting plans?**

**Voice acting scope:**

- **Fully voiced** - All dialogue recorded
- **Partially voiced** - Key scenes only
- **Grunts/barks only** - No full dialogue
- **Text only** - No voice acting

**If voiced:**

- Number of characters needing voices?
- Approximate dialogue volume?
- Professional or placeholder voices?

Describe your voice acting approach:"

### 4. Generate Production Content

Based on the conversation, prepare the content:

```markdown
## Production Planning

### Writing Scope

**Estimated Word Count:** {{word_count}}

**Content Breakdown:**

- Main story: {{main_story_words}}
- Side content: {{side_content_words}}
- Environmental/lore: {{lore_words}}
- UI/system text: {{ui_words}}

**Scene Count:** {{scene_count}}

**Dialogue Lines:** {{line_count}}

**Branching Complexity:**
{{branching_impact_on_scope}}

---

### Localization

{{if_localizing}}
**Target Languages:**
{{language_list}}

**Cultural Adaptation Notes:**
{{adaptation_needs}}

**Technical Considerations:**

- Text expansion buffer: {{percentage}}
- UI flexibility: {{notes}}
- Audio approach: {{dub_or_subtitle}}
  {{/if_localizing}}

{{if_english_only}}
**Approach:** English only
**Future consideration:** {{maybe_later_notes}}
{{/if_english_only}}

---

### Voice Acting

**Approach:** {{voice_acting_level}}

{{if_voiced}}
**Characters Needing Voices:** {{character_count}}

**Dialogue Volume:** {{line_count_for_recording}}

**Voice Cast Notes:**
{{casting_considerations}}

**Recording Approach:**
{{professional_or_placeholder}}
{{/if_voiced}}

{{if_not_voiced}}
**Rationale:** {{why_no_voice}}
{{/if_not_voiced}}
```

### 5. Present Content and Menu

Show the generated content to the user and present:

"I've documented the production planning.

**Here's what I'll add to the document:**

[Show the complete markdown content from step 4]

**Production Summary:**

- Writing: ~{{word_count}} words
- Localization: {{languages_or_none}}
- Voice acting: {{level}}

**Validation Check:**

- Is scope realistic for your resources?
- Have you considered all production needs?
- Are localization needs addressed?

**Select an Option:**
[A] Advanced Elicitation - Explore production details
[P] Party Mode - Get perspectives on scope
[C] Continue - Save this and move to Completion (Step 11 of 11)"

### 6. Handle Menu Selection

#### IF A (Advanced Elicitation):

- Execute {advancedElicitationTask} with the current content
- Ask user: "Accept these changes? (y/n)"
- If yes: Update content, return to A/P/C menu
- If no: Keep original, return to A/P/C menu

#### IF P (Party Mode):

- Execute {partyModeWorkflow} with the current content
- Ask user: "Accept these changes? (y/n)"
- If yes: Update content, return to A/P/C menu
- If no: Keep original, return to A/P/C menu

#### IF C (Continue):

- Append the final content to `{outputFile}`
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
- Load `{nextStepFile}`

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN [C continue option] is selected and [production content saved with frontmatter updated], will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}`.

## SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### SUCCESS:

- Writing scope estimated
- Localization needs addressed
- Voice acting approach defined
- Realistic production expectations set
- A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly
- Frontmatter updated with stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

### SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Estimating scope without user input
- Missing major production considerations
- Unrealistic expectations set
- Not presenting A/P/C menu after content
- Proceeding without user selecting 'C'

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
