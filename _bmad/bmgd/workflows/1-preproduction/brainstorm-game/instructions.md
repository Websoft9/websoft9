{{#if standalone_mode != true}}
**Status Updated:**

- Progress tracking updated: brainstorm-game marked complete
- Next workflow: {{next_workflow}}
  {{else}}
  **Note:** Running in standalone mode (no progress tracking)
  {{/if}}

**Next Steps:**

{{#if standalone_mode != true}}

- **Next workflow:** {{next_workflow}} ({{next_agent}} agent)
- **Optional:** You can run other analysis workflows (research, game-brief) before proceeding

Check status anytime with: `workflow-status`

Since no workflow is in progress:

- Refer to the BMM workflow guide if unsure what to do next
- Or run `workflow-init` to create a workflow path and get guided next steps
