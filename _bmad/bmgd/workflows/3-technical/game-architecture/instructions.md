# Decision Architecture Workflow Instructions

<workflow name="architecture">

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project-root}/_bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>This workflow uses ADAPTIVE FACILITATION - adjust your communication style based on {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>The goal is ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS that prevent AI agent conflicts, not detailed implementation specs</critical>
<critical>Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and tailor to {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>
<critical>This workflow replaces architecture with a conversation-driven approach</critical>
<critical>Input documents specified in workflow.yaml input_file_patterns - workflow engine handles fuzzy matching, whole vs sharded document discovery automatically</critical>
<critical>ELICITATION POINTS: After completing each major architectural decision area (identified by template-output tags for decision_record, project_structure, novel_pattern_designs, implementation_patterns, and architecture_document), invoke advanced elicitation to refine decisions before proceeding</critical>
<critical>⚠️ ABSOLUTELY NO TIME ESTIMATES - NEVER mention hours, days, weeks, months, or ANY time-based predictions. AI has fundamentally changed development speed - what once took teams weeks/months can now be done by one person in hours. DO NOT give ANY time estimates whatsoever.</critical>
<critical>⚠️ CHECKPOINT PROTOCOL: After EVERY <template-output> tag, you MUST follow workflow.xml substep 2c: SAVE content to file immediately → SHOW checkpoint separator (━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━) → DISPLAY generated content → PRESENT options [a]Advanced Elicitation/[c]Continue/[p]Party-Mode/[y]YOLO → WAIT for user response. Never batch saves or skip checkpoints.</critical>

<output>✅ Decision Architecture workflow complete!</output>

<output>**Deliverables Created:**

- ✅ architecture.md - Complete architectural decisions document
  {{if_novel_patterns}}
- ✅ Novel pattern designs for unique concepts
  {{/if_novel_patterns}}
  {{if_starter_template}}
- ✅ Project initialization command documented
  {{/if_starter_template}}

The architecture is ready to guide AI agents through consistent implementation.

**Next Steps:**

- **Next required:** {{next_workflow}} ({{next_agent}} agent)
- Review the architecture.md document before proceeding

Check status anytime with: `workflow-status`
